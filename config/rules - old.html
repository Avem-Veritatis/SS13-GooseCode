		<br><dt>Welcome to ArchAngel Station. There are a few notable rules we have here. Failure to comply with these rules may incur a warning, an admin intervention, a banning or all three. If you want to dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest. ArchAngel Station Rules 


Welcome to ArchAngel Station, we aim to optimize your time here with us. We have a number of rules for each individual to follow while they enjoy themselves. You may notice some rules are common sense, while others may not be. Whenever you have doubts, feel free to ahelp at any time. While ideally we aim to have concrete rules where everything is black and white, due to the nature of WH40K and ss13 this is more or less impossible. The general spirit we like to promote aims at recognition that everybody is a human, even the staff. While the universe of WH40K is grimdark, that does not mean that players have to be a jerk to one another. The rules are meant to be kept as simple and easy to follow as possible. Failure to comply with these rules may incur a warning, an admin intervention, a banning or all three. If you want to dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest.

<p>

Rule #1.) Maintain and promote a welcoming and healthy playing atmosphere. Some players are new, some players have different sets of social skills and play styles. Taking the time to teach and develop  relationships with other players is the best thing you can do in ss13. Bigotry is not welcome here; racist, sexist, homophobic, religious slurs, and anything of the like is not taken lightly. Harassing players in OOC is to be avoided. Equally, do not flame other servers. Enjoy the game in peace.

<p>

Rule #2.) Metagaming is using any sort of OOC knowledge and using it in game, don't do this. No IC in OOC, no OOC in IC (this includes net speak). Multikeying, silent teams, exploits, logging on to cause destruction and logging out, and any sort of related behavior falls under this. 

<p>

Rule #3.) Keep Character names appropriate and believable. Use the first and last name format. Clowns and mimes do not have to follow this. 

<p>

Rule #4.) While mildly lewd jokes may be fine every so often, absolutely no forms of erotic role play is permitted. 

<p>

Rule #5.) For the most part, play the role you have chosen or fallen into. While Mary Sues are not against the server rules, this behavior may be frowned upon IC. If you become an antag, or have your antag status revoked, continue the round accordingly. You may role play however you wish, but directly going against team antagonist roles or loyalty implants is against the rules. This rule also covers synthetics, which have to follow the laws they have.

<p>

Rule #6.)Communicate openly, respectfully, and clearly. If there is a problem, question, concern, etc., take a moment to calmly and clearly explain your issue in an ahelp so an admin may assist you as quickly and efficiently as possible. If you wish to speak with a different admin at any time, you may request this. If you are still unsatisfied, everybody is encouraged to take all issues to the forums where the entire administrative staff may review the issue at hand. Equally, please do not spam the ahelps, and remain courteous and mature. 

<p>

Rule #7.) Killing is allowed in a role playing manner. Silently RDMing is not allowed. Dying is apart of the grimdark universe, and ss13 as a whole. Some examples of this include joining chaos space marines as a role played chaos convert, an inquisitor purging those believed to be heretical or influenced by xenos. 

<p>

Rule #8.) Avoid at all costs doing things that will cause lag, and large scale make the map inaccessible, unless you have reason to do so. This includes large scale bombings, releasing plasma, and a variety of related behaviors.  
<p>

End Notes: Please speak only English on the server. Have fun, but be mindful that others are trying to have fun as well. Having fun together as a group is often more fun than enjoying something at another's expense. Don't heavily debate rules with admins; if an admin asks you to please stop, then please comply, and take the remainder of what you wish to say to the forums. Please do not be demeaning when pointing out rules to others. If you must, simply ahelp, and administrative staff will take it from there. Simply relax and enjoy the game. Ignorance of the rules is no excuse, and attempting to use that as an excuse may warrant harsher punishments, as it is a sign of disrespect to the server for disregarding carefully put together rules for the benefit and enjoyment of the community.
