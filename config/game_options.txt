### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. 
RUN_DELAY 2
WALK_DELAY 4

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 0
MONKEY_DELAY 0
ALIEN_DELAY 0
SLIME_DELAY 0
ANIMAL_DELAY 0

### EXPLOSIONS ###

## Unhash this to use recursive explosions, keep it hashed to use normal style explosions.
## Recursive explosions react to walls, airlocks and blast doors, making them look a lot cooler
## than the boring old circular explosions. They require more CPU and are (as of March 2013) experimental.
## The default map is generally designed for the old style explosions in terms of security.

#USE_RECURSIVE_EXPLOSIONS
