		<br><dt>Welcome to Absolution. There are a few notable rules we have here. Failure to comply with these rules may incur a warning, an admin intervention, a banning or all three. If you want to dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest. <p>

Absolution Rules

<p>

For Humans:

<p>

1: Killing other humans without appropriate justification is against the rules. 

<p>

 1b: If said human is a confirmed antagonist, resisting arrest violently, or assisting violent non-humans or antagonists, killing is justified. 

<p>

 1c: Killing of non-humans is freely permissible, however it is discouraged unless said non-humans are openly hostile, either in action or words.

<p>

 1d: The eldar spy (selectable job) counts as being human.

<p>

 1e: The celebrity counts as being human only until they have taken a heart for their quest.

<p>

 1f: The mime counts as human up till they have constructed their makeshift soulstone.

<p>

2: Inquisitors may execute humans found guilty of Heresy.

<p>

 2a: Heresy refers to acts opposed to the God Emperor, counter to the crew, or in favor of any Xenos or Heretics, questioning an Inquisitor’s authority is also a form of heresy. Whilst these definitions are vague, you must be able to back them up. 

<p>

 2b: The Inquisitor is not a license for a murder spree, and treating it as such will result in a job ban, and in extreme cases, server ban. 

<p>

For RTD's

<p>

1.The ordo hereticus inquisitors are only allowed to use exterminatus IF, the inquisitors, Lord General, and another head of office agree that it is the only viable solution. If one or more of these is absent you must ahelp or send a message to centcomm.  If there are no admins then use your absolute best judgement.

<p>

2. ALL RTD's are only allowed to hit the RTD button once.

<p>

  2b. Alternative methods for getting additional RTD members in are allowed.

<p>

3. The ork RTD's are allowed to have infighting, but not en masse.  for example an ork gretchin could "accidentally" shoot a nob or something in the back, but not throw a stikkbomb under their feet en masse. (Try to keep it honourably robust with dakka and choppa)

<p>

  3b: Orks without a warboss are encouraged to go ham on one another.

<p>

For Non-Humans:

<p>

1: Killing of humans by non-humans is discouraged for Tau and Eldar.

<p>

 1a: Tau are encouraged to attempt to convert the outpost to the ways of the greater good through diplomacy, however they may complete their goals how they wish.

<p>

 1b: Eldar are encouraged to peacefully complete any objectives, or otherwise be stealthy knife eared bastards. Eldar are expected to be able to justify their kills, if any.

<p>

2: Tyranid and Necrons are expected to be outwardly hostile towards Humans, and disregard opportunities for diplomacy. 

<p>

3: Orks may try to be freebootaz, guns for hire, or odd merchants, to the outpost and crew, however, they are not required to be, and may, if they desire, be hostile. 

<p>

For All Players:

<p>

1: No ERP. Please do not attempt Erotic Roleplay in game. Romance is perfectly permissible. Keep it daytime TV friendly.

<p>

2: No OOC in IC, or vice versa. Do not use OOC channels to refer to the current round, or IC channels to refer to things unrelated to the current round. 

<p>

 2a: No drama in OOC. Do not instigate, participate in, or encourage, any drama in Out Of Character channels. 

<p>

3: No Metagaming of any kind. Do not use out of game knowledge ingame.

<p>

 3a: No Metacommunication, using out-of-game tools to communicate with another player. 

<p>

4: Do not attempt to cause significant server lag. This includes starting plasma fires and flooding the outpost with plasma. 

<p>

5: Players must speak English, the only exceptions being lore-friendly reasons, such as the Chaplain speaking Latin or Mechanicus speaking Binary. 

<p>

6: Racism and homophobia will not be tolerated. Lore-friendly xenophobia, and bigotry is perfectly permissible. 

<p>

7: Players who attempt to ruin rounds, destroy the outpost for no explainable reason, or gather overwhelming ire from the server populace, may also be kicked or banned. In short, do not be a dick. This rule is only to be exercised by the Headmin, Senior Admins, or Norc. 

<p>

8: No one except GEESE are permitted to hold events. Please test me on this.

<p>

9: Admins may make use of the dead, within reason. (Don't turn them all into antag army)

<p>

   9A: If there are no antags currently aboard the outpost, RTD or otherwise, an admin may convert one of the crewmen into an antagonist with reasonable objectives.

<p>

10: All players are only allowed to RTD once.  Violations of this may include removal of violator from their RTD faction with no chance of re-entry.

<p>

11: Players are not permitted to commit suicide once they have entered either the cult of the ruinous powers or a genestealer cult.  To do so is bad sportsmanship and just rude overall after all the trouble they went through.(however you may log out, as your empty husk of a body can be dragged to runes)
 
<p>

  11A: Players who become a member of the cult are not allowed to act against the cult, and if your a construct of some sort you MUST follow the will of the cult.  This applies to genestealer and chaos cults. However genestealer and chaos cults are seperate and may fuck eachother up.


<p>

12: in regards to antagonists.  

<p>

  12A: If you are of an imperial nature, such as a callidus assasin, you must do your utmost to ensure you only complete your specific objectives without collateral damage, you may only kill others in self defense, or if there is no other way to complete your objective.

<p>

  12B: If you are a heretic (tator) you are only allowed to complete your specific objectives, and may only kill in self defense, or if there is no other way to complete your objective. (stealth is of utmost important to a heretic, for he knows not if he will have any help.)

<p>

  12C: If you are a callidus assasin who is a heretic, rule 12A still applies.

<p>

  12D: If you are a cultist, you must do your absolute utmost to gain more followers, sacrificing only humanized monkeys and targets, however as with other antags you may kill in defense of the cult. (if someone is about to find out and you can't convert them, people who can't be converted at all, stuff like that)

<p>
  
  12E: If you are a wizard (eldar warlock) You must only do your specified objectives, only killing in self defense, after completing your objectives you must only survive till the end of the round, helping the outpost is optional.(you could just hide in a closet or disposal chute till round end if you want.)

<p>

  12F: The following antags/RTD factions are considered to have a license to kill(they don't have to follow rules 1-1F) Blob, Necron Lord, Blood pact;  Plague Marines, Thousand Sons marines, Tyranids, Orks.

<p>

  12G: The following RTD factions are considered to have a license to kill after confirming a heretic cult, Nurgle based plague, or on the orders of inquisitors (in the case of inquisitional orders they are only allowed to kill who they have been ordered to kill), otherwise they must do their best to keep the outpost alive and well, as well as conforming to any rules their leader puts forth; Salamander space marines, Raven Guard Space Marines, Adeptus Sororitas, Ultramarines, Imperial Guard, Inquisition Ordo Hereticus.

<p>

  12H: The Tau Faction is given a license to kill once any of them have been fired upon. (shoot at one, they all shoot back)

<p>

  12I: The khorne bezerker(spawned by sword things) Have a free license to kill.

<p>

13: Admins have the right to mute ahelp and other things if the player in question is spamming, being a shitter, or otherwise being unprofessional.
