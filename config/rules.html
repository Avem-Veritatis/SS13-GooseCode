		<br><dt>Welcome to Absolution. There are a few notable rules we have here. Failure to comply with these rules may incur a warning, an admin intervention, a banning or all three. If you want to dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest. <p>

Absolution Rules

<p>

For All Players:

<p>

 1: No ERP. Please do not attempt Erotic Roleplay in game. Romance is perfectly permissible. Keep it daytime TV friendly(No more than two shakes).

<p>

 2: No OOC in IC, or vice versa. Do not use OOC channels to refer to the current round, or IC channels to refer to things unrelated to the current round.

<p>

 3: No Metagaming of any kind. Do not use out of game knowledge ingame.

<p>

 4: Do not attempt to cause significant server lag or ruin the round. This includes starting plasma fires and flooding the outpost with plasma.

<p>

 5: Players must speak English, the only exceptions being lore-friendly reasons, such as the Chaplain speaking Latin or Mechanicus speaking Binary.

<p>

 6: No Verbally attacking or insulting players in OOC or causing uneeded Drama.

<p>

 8: Players are not permitted to commit suicide once they have entered either the cult of the ruinous powers or a genestealer cult. To do so is bad sportsmanship However you may Logout or ghost.

<p>

 10: If you are a wizard (eldar warlock) You must only do your specified objectives, only killing in self defense, after completing your objectives you must only survive till the end of the round, helping the outpost is optional.(you could just hide in a closet or disposal chute till round end if you want).
<p>

 11: The following RTD factions are considered to have a license to kill after confirming a heretic cult, Nurgle based plague, or on the orders of inquisitors (in the case of inquisitional orders they are only allowed to kill who they have been ordered to kill), otherwise they must do their best to keep the outpost alive and well, as well as conforming to any rules their leader puts forth; Salamander space marines, Raven Guard Space Marines, Adeptus Sororitas, Ultramarines, Imperial Guard, Inquisition Ordo Hereticus.

<p>

 12: The Tau Faction is given a license to kill once any of them have been fired upon. (shoot at one, they all shoot back)

<p>

 13: Admins have the right to mute ahelp and other things if the player in question is spamming, being a shitter, or otherwise being unprofessional.

<p>

For Humans:

<p>

 1: Killing other humans without appropriate justification is against the rules.

<p>

 2: If said human is a confirmed antagonist, resisting arrest violently, or assisting violent non-humans or antagonists, killing is justified.

<p>

 3: Killing of non-humans is freely permissible, however it is discouraged unless said non-humans are openly hostile, either in action or words.

<p>

 4: The Inquisitor is not a license for a murder spree, and treating it as such will result in a job ban, and in extreme cases, server ban.

<p>

For RTD's

<p>

 1: The ordo hereticus inquisitors are only allowed to use exterminatus IF, the inquisitors, Lord General, and another head of office agree that it is the only viable solution. If one or more of these is absent you must ahelp or send a message to centcomm. If there are no admins then use your absolute best judgement.

<p>

 2: You may only RTD Once unless you have admin approval, Violation of this rule wlill result in your Removal of all RTD list.

<p>

 2. Alternative methods for getting additional RTD members in are allowed (Try to be ork, etc).

<p>

 3. The ork RTD's are allowed to have infighting, but not en masse. for example an ork gretchin could "accidentally" shoot a nob or something in the back, but not throw a stikkbomb under their feet en masse. (Try to keep it honourably robust with dakka and choppa)

<p>

 4: Orks without a warboss are encouraged to go ham on one another.

<p>

 5: Astartes are to follow this guide: ( http://archangelstation.enjin.com/rtd/m/32244106/viewthread/29590424-we-need-rules-engagement-for-astartes-rtd/ )

For Non-Humans:

<p>

 1: Killing of humans by non-humans is discouraged for Tau and Eldar.

<p>

 2: Tau are encouraged to attempt to convert the outpost to the ways of the greater good through diplomacy, however they may complete their goals how they wish.

<p>

 3: Eldar are encouraged to peacefully complete any objectives, or otherwise be stealthy knife eared bastards. Eldar are expected to be able to justify their kills, if any.

<p>

 4: Tyranid and Necrons are expected to be outwardly hostile towards Humans, and disregard opportunities for diplomacy.

<p>

 5: Orks may try to be freebootaz, guns for hire, or odd merchants, to the outpost and crew, however, they are not required to be, and may, if they desire, be hostile.
